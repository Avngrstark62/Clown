# Clown - A Fun Social Media Platform Project

**Visit App** [**Here**](https://clownapp.fun)  

Clown is a cool social media platform **built as a side project for fun and learning**. It mimics popular social media features like posts, likes, comments, and real-time chat, offering a hands-on way to explore full-stack development, AI integrations, and modern deployment practices. Built with cutting-edge technologies, Clown serves as a playground for experimenting with scalable architectures, authentication systems, and real-time communication. While itâ€™s not a production-ready platform, itâ€™s a great way to understand how social media platforms work under the hood.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases set up.
- AWS EC2 instance configured (optional for local development).
- Different API keys mentioned in the .env files.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Avngrstark62/Clown.git
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following variables:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=jwt_secret_key
   JWT_EXPIRES=7d
   PORT=8000
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=cloudinary_api_secret
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url
   AI_SERVICE_URL=http://ai-service:8001
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_email
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `ai-service` folder with the following variable:
   ```env
   HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token
   ```

4. Run the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured domain).

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Chat Features**: Better UI, typing indicator, unread messages indicator.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for new messages, likes, comments, and new followers.
- **Explore Page**: Discover new posts and users based on interests.

---

## Limitations 
- Clown is currently deployed on an **AWS EC2 t3.micro instance**, which is a low-resource instance suitable for small-scale testing and development. As a result, it cannot handle a large number of users or high traffic.  
- The AI features (image captioning and caption generation) rely on external APIs and models, which may introduce latency or limitations based on usage.  
- The real-time chat system is basic and lacks advanced features like typing indicators, or read receipts.  
- The platform is optimized for learning and experimentation, not for production use or scalability.
